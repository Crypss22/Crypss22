<h1>Hey, I'm Chris! <br/><a href="https://www.wgu.edu/">Undergraduate Cybersecurity Student🧑🏽‍🎓</a></h1>
  <h4>ABOUT ME</h4>
  
  <p>My name is Christopher Feurtado and I'm a transitioning active-duty service member and undergraduate student, pursuing a B.S. in Cybersecurity & Information Insurance. In my downtime from work and school, I use various online resources to enhance my knowledge and technical skills. These courses and projects below that I've completed, and currently working on, are exciting and I wanted to use this repository as a blog to document it all. Due to being in a non-technical field in the military, I have to be a dedicated self-learner and I thorougly enjoy taking a proactive approach in teaching myself new things everyday. When I have the time to I also attend study groups with like-minded individuals pursuing the same goals. I'm excited to pursue this career field and look forward to the opportunities it brings.</p>
